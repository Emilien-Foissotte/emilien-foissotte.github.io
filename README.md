This site is made with ❤️ (and few ☕) by Emilien Foissotte using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

Have a nice glance, happy to see you here !

## How to

[Install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/)

Then review your content `hugo server`

If that sounds right, push to the `main` branch, Github Action will cary on the job to
deploy it.
