Hi,

<img class="centered" src="/img/me/me.png"/>

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [SITA](https://www.sita.aero/), where we develop and ship
ML models to reduce fuel consumption ⛽, and therefore carbon footprint 🍃 of aircrafts with
[Optiflight](https://www.sita.aero/solutions/sita-for-aircraft/digital-day-of-operations/optiflight/) .

Before joining SITA, I worked at [Safran](https://www.safran-group.com/), a turbofan
engine crafting and maintenance compagny ✈️ on predictive maintenance topics.

I'm an engineer from [ISAE-ENSMA](https://www.ensma.fr/) an engineering school 🏫 specialized in aeronautics
and transportation systems.
My education and academic backougn is a mix of computer science 🤖, math ➗ and physics
(fluids, thermal, solids)🔬
I went in ML/Data Science topics in 2019 after discovering in a school project where we
 tried to modelize weather 🌡️ for smartgrids ⚡.

I enjoy [programming](https://github.com/Emilien-Foissotte) on my day life.
At night, I kick out some [blog post]('https://emilien-foissotte.github.io/') and love exploring new topics, exposing stuff on my [website](emilienfoissotte.fr).

Beside work, I enjoy [reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) 📚, watching [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_of_the_12th)  🎬,
listening to [podcasts](https://www.binge.audio/podcast/programme-b)🎙️, [cooking](https://www.undejeunerdesoleil.com/), crafting some DIY cosmetics, visting places of art, travelling, hiking, rowing and exploring new topics.
