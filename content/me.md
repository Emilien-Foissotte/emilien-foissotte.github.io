![Me](/img/me/me.png#center)

Hi ! 👋

I'm a Machine Learning Engineer at [SITA](https://www.sita.aero/), in a team where we develop and deploy
ML models to reduce fuel consumption ⛽, and therefore carbon footprint 🍃 of aircrafts with
[Optiflight](https://www.sita.aero/solutions/sita-for-aircraft/digital-day-of-operations/optiflight/) .

Before joining SITA, I worked at [Safran](https://www.safran-group.com/), a turbofan
engine crafting and maintenance compagny ✈️ on predictive maintenance topics.

I'm an engineer from [ISAE-ENSMA](https://www.ensma.fr/) an engineering school 🏫 specialized in aeronautics
and transportation systems.


My education and academic backougn is a mix of computer science 🤖, math ➗ and physics
(fluids, thermal, solids)🔬
I went in ML/Data Science topics in 2019 after discovering in a school project where we
 tried to modelize weather 🌡️ for smartgrids ⚡.

I enjoy [programming](https://github.com/Emilien-Foissotte/) on my day life.
At night, I kick out some [blog post](/archives/), craft some [projects](https://www.datascienceportfol.io/EmilienFoissotte), I do love so much exploring new topics !

Beside work, I enjoy [reading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Animal_Farm) 📚, watching [movies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_of_the_12th)  🎬,
listening to [podcasts](https://www.binge.audio/podcast/programme-b)🎙️, [cooking](https://www.undejeunerdesoleil.com), crafting some DIY cosmetics, visting places of art, travelling, hiking, rowing and stay curious.
