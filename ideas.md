# WIP Tracker (for my own work organization)

Let's be a little bit more organized here.

Shy out from README.md has it is not a arguiably good front page for this public webpage.
Let's keep it solely for me and for curious people that might engage reading theses lines (glad to see you here
if so, happy to see that my ideas picked up some curiosity).

In order to get in a glimpse the feel I express reviewing these old posts. The idea is to try for each post
avoid previous caveats and bad pattern I encountered. Let's also be incremental, a from time to time
add some remarks. Every idea cannot come up once so let time do his job giving ideas.

## Who's my audience ?

People that might encounter same curiosity on some topics, enjoying reviewing a blog post. I would rather
follow short but fun blog posts, with detailed and informative informative. Reproductive also should
be taken in account. For me to reproduce fun stuff I've done, later (kinda self archive), but
also for other so that they can try themselves. What is like is DIY, so let's help do a bit of introduce
a bit of DOT (Do It Themselves) in order to give back the incredible amount of stuff I encountered
on the internet.

So rather be fun (for me at least, and other I if can, I will definitely try), grasp trendy topics,
concise and reproducible (hard to keep up with concise, it's a narrow line but doable)

## Done posts (Review)

- [x] Set up comment system and counter for engagement, as well as portfolio

23/07 :

- First post, I would have would have encountered this kind of aggregated view of how to do. Bootstrap is
  import.

* Not very reproducible, maybe I should have split up in different posts and be more descriptive (GH way not much
  descriptive

* [x]Â Portable IDE, to describe how get and transition from GUI IDE to something handy like tmux + neovim

23/07 :

- A bit more informative than earlier, more pictures so cool to display.

* Writing is not cool. Hard to follow along, not catchy, no real history skeleton.

## Advancements (current post to go is ticked)

### Note for current article to go.

Review the setup on the pi to be sure it's Ok with fail2ban. Would have love to split work, but
letting guys fire up some unprotected Raspberry and saying "Hey, I'm gonna talk about it later" felt
a little bit unresponsible to me.

Intro is good, need to make it a little bit more catchy but fine.

Tackle the backup thing. Be more descriptive with the file, using gists maybe ?

Snapshots of Android are going to be necessary to be more instructive on DAVx5 setup and so on.

Need to give more credit to source articles !

### Data / ML

- [x] Gas App to track close gas station --> cool for me but not much Carbon free for the world.
      Need to rework with streamlit yet. A lot of increments and never felt happy with final result.
- [ ] Movie recommender system using MovieLens, plus Deep Learning for recommendation identified and
      airflow to setup a DAG to retrain on freshly noted movies. I've fucked up my 4 gb Raspberry trying
      to fire up airflow, so I will rather make upgrade my central server to a 8gb raspberry, it is currently on track
      for delivery.

### Home Tweaking

- [ ] Private Google at home with Nextcloud (Calendar, Photos, Files and Contacts). Need to work on backup
      setting so I can share about that.
- [ ] Deploy PiHole --> Done. Need to write about it and it fuck\*ng have speed up my old phone.
- [ ] Plex + Headless JDownloader for incredible downloading combo. (Given the Uptobox storage
      for Nextcloud backup, it's a killer)
## TODO

- [ ] Meteo Learning model would be cool (using OpenWeather API to get local data)
